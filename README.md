## 🚀 Features

* Email-based user login
* Background worker service for processing tasks
* Validation and business rules handled in service layer
* Repository / data access abstraction
* Unit tests and integration tests
* Clean architecture (Core / Infrastructure / UI / Tests)
* Easy to extend (e.g., add UI, API, alternate storage)

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The solution uses a layered architecture to separate concerns:

* **Core** — Domain models, interfaces, business logic contracts
* **Infrastructure** — Implementations of repositories / data persistence
* **UI** — The user interface (or entry point)
* **Tests** — Unit and integration tests

Dependency inversion is applied: higher-level layers depend on abstractions in Core, not concrete implementations.

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET SDK (8.0 or newer)
* IDE (Visual Studio / VS Code / Rider)
* Git

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yamenArmeet/EmailLoginAndWorkerService.git
cd EmailLoginAndWorkerService
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Configuration

If your Infrastructure layer uses a database (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite), update connection strings (e.g., in `appsettings.json` or environment variables) as needed. Run migrations if applicable:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project EmailLoginAndWorkerService.Infrastructure
```

*(Skip if using in-memory or file-based storage.)*

### Run the Project

Launch the UI (or whatever your front-end is). For example:

```bash
dotnet run --project EmailLoginAndWorkerService.UI
```

Or open the solution in Visual Studio, set the UI or startup project, and run (F5).

---

## ✅ Testing

Run all tests with:

```bash
dotnet test
```

You can also run individual test projects, for example:

```bash
dotnet test EmailLoginAndWorkerService.ServiceTests
dotnet test EmailLoginAndWorkerService.IntegrationTests
```

Ensure all tests pass before merging changes.

---

## 📋 Usage

1. Launch the UI or API interface.
2. Use the “Login” form to authenticate with email.
3. View the dashboard or main interface.
4. Background tasks will be processed automatically.
5. Optionally, add filters, search, validations, etc.
